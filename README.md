# i3wm-convenience

Welcome to my little project to help i3wm newbees with several first steps in the great world of [i3wm](https://i3wm.org). If there are any questions regarding my solutions or suggestions how to improve them, feel free to contact me or just open an issue.

## Operating System

When I setup my current environment I was confronted with the question which OS shall be taken. I know this is a very personal question for everyone. I decided for [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/), because it is widely spread and I am already used to it. Feel free to use your flavour, but be aware that my solutions here are tested on Ubuntu only. If anything changes in the future, it changes. :)

## Disclaimer

I am not associated with anyone from the i3wm project and consider myself as nothing more than a newbie, that wants to save other people's time by collecting some hacks and tools that I stumbled upon on my way here.
